**Undergraduate Research Assistant. Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (_Aug '21 - June '22_)**
- Supervised by Prof. [Sujit Manna](https://iitd.irins.org/profile/90515).
- Investigated the essential proximity-induced superconducting properties of a proximity-induced Pt quantum nanowire system.
- Performed extensive data analyses on novel experimental datasets to study the interactions between single magnetic adatoms (in this case, EuS molecules) and proximity-induced Pt and Au superconducting substrates, with the intention of detecting signatures of Majorana zero modes in these systems. These studies are expected to find novel applications in the realization of topological qubits (inspired by Kitaev’s 1D magnetic adatoms linear chain model) to facilitate fault-tolerant quantum computation.
