- Working on modeling the steady-state statistics of classical nonlinear dynamical systems on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Devices.
- Invoked dynamical decoupling within the quantum phase estimation (QPE) circuit as a means to test for performance improvements.
- Currently performing comparative analyses between the QPE and variational quantum deflation (VQD) algorithms for the quantum simulation of said classical nonlinear dynamical systems.
- Currently working on using our implementation(s) to extract the steady-state statistics of the Held-Suarez climate model (see [arXiv:2304.03362](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03362)).
- Worked on using our implementation(s) to extract the steady-state statistics of the Schlogl model, a paradigmatic example of a stochastic chemical reaction network known to exhibit multiple non-equilibrium steady-states.
- One manuscript is out on arXiv [arXiv:2404.08870](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.08770) while a second manuscript is currently underway (future works to follow).
- Our results were recently presented at the APS March Meeting 2024 in Minneapolis, Minnesota ([link to the abstract](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR24/Session/K49.3)).

- Developed a full analytical model of a TOP trap.
- Was successfully able to devise a control scheme to achieving a focusing (of matter waves) on the order of 1e-5 through numerical modeling. Further work focused on making the control scheme robust to nonlinear perturbations.

**Undergraduate Research Assistant. Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (_Aug '21 - June '22_)**
- Supervised by Prof. [Sujit Manna](https://iitd.irins.org/profile/90515).
- Investigated the essential proximity-induced superconducting properties of a proximity-induced Pt quantum nanowire system.
- Performed extensive data analyses on novel experimental datasets to study the interactions between single magnetic adatoms (in this case, EuS molecules) and proximity-induced Pt and Au superconducting substrates, with the intention of detecting signatures of Majorana zero modes in these systems. These studies are expected to find novel applications in the realization of topological qubits (inspired by Kitaev’s 1D magnetic adatoms linear chain model) to facilitate fault-tolerant quantum computation.

- Obtained theoretical bounds on the experimental parameter space that will be relevant for realizing the proposed QGEM (Quantum Gravity via Entanglement of Masses) experiment.

- Worked on Project Starshot – aims at sending ultralight probes to the alpha-Centauri star system within the next few decades.
- Developed computer simulations for the optical analysis of the 2D asymmetric Si gratings that are proposed to be placed on the sails (that are to be fitted to the probes for the purpose of propulsion (via radiation pressure)).
- Developed computer simulations for the analysis of the mechanical stability of the sails and the probes while at peak cruising velocities.

**Undergraduate Research Assistant. The Australian National University (_Nov '20 - April '21_)**
- Supervised by Prof. [David R. Williams](https://physics.anu.edu.au/contact/people/profile.php?ID=55&tab=publications).
- Developed an analytical model for the stochastic entropy distribution along transient trajectories for a system consisting of a Brownian particle optically confined within an arbitrary power-law trap (immersed in a viscous fluid and translating linearly at constant acceleration).
- Demonstrated through computer simulations that the transient fluctuation theorem also applies to nonequilibrium steady-state distributions at colloidal length and time scales. Numerical results bore excellent correspondence with theoretical results published previously.
- Work published in the European Physical Journal Plus. [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjp/s13360-022-03395-y).

**Undergraduate Research Assistant. Yale University (_Jul '20 - Jan '21_)**
- Supervised by Prof. [Steven M. Girvin](https://physics.yale.edu/people/steven-girvin).
- Developed a 2-party computation protocol that takes in as its input, an n-bit randomized string (proven to be unconditionally-secure under certain standard computational and cryptographic assumptions).
-  Devised an experimental scheme that ensures very high state-detection and state-readout fidelities from neutral atom qubit arrays (by suppressing errors encountered due to photon-scattering crosstalk).
-   This work led to an original thesis that encompassed a wide range of topics in quantum computing; in particular, cold-atom quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and public-/private-key quantum money.
